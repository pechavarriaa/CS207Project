# CS207Project
Source code and documentation for 3x3 Led-Cube

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
- Neopixels (Preferably the mini-pcb ones) here is a neopixel breakdown by Phillip Burgess from Adafruit https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide.pdf
- Soldering iron along with soldering wire, wires to connect neopixels
- Arduino nano
- HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth Module
- Android Phone
- Paper Card (to make diffusers)
- Magnets
- 3D printed parts from STL file
- 24 M4 bolts and 24 M4 nuts
  
### Software
- Arduino IDE
- FastLED library from https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED
- Rubiks3x3.h Header from this repository 
- Android Studio (optional to make custom app for the cube)
          
## Assemble
First start by 3D printing the cube from 3D files folder. Then
assemble 9 neopixels per face from the cube. Then solder the neopixels
in this order ![Soldering Order](https://github.com/pechavarriaa/CS207Project/blob/master/img/SolderingOrder.JPG {width=40px height=400px})
